# `./faker/` directory

This directory contains the source code for creating user-defined amount of fake data in CSV for testing purposes. The data will be stored in a CSV file in the `./faker/data/` directory, which is scoped out of git by `.gitignore`.

## Usage

Assuming your current working directory is at the root of this repository, you can run the following command to generate fake data:

```bash
$ npm run faker
```

The above command will generate 200,000 fake data entries in the `./faker/data/` directory. You can change the amount of data generated by changing the value of the `ENTRIES` variable in `faker.js`.
