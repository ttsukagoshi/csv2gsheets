# csv2gsheets: Create & update Google Sheets files using your local CSV

A Node.js CLI tool to convert local CSV files into Google Sheets files in a designated Google Drive folder. Users can choose whether to update an existing Sheets file, or create a new one.

## What is it for?

## Setup

### Install Node.js

Install the [latest LTS version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). A simple way to check if you have Node.js installed is to type the following command on your Terminal or PowerShell (or anything else):

```bash
node -v
```

### Install csv2gsheets

On your Terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g csv2gsheets
```

Run `csv2gsheets` to confirm your installation:

```bash
c2g --help
```

`c2g` is the shorthand for running `csv2gsheets`. All commands in the following sections will use this shortened version, but they can all be replaced by its full name. For example:

```bash
c2g convert --dry-run
```

is the equivalent to running

```bash
csv2gsheets convert --dry-run
```

#### Updating csv2gheets

New releases will be posted on the GitHub repository. To update your installed version, run:

```bash
npm update -g csv2gsheets
```
